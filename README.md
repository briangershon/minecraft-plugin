# PluginDemo

This is a starter Minecraft plugin.

Features:

* Minimal Minecraft Plugin based on [Creating a blank Spigot plugin, using Maven](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/creating-a-plugin-with-maven-using-intellij-idea/).
* Minimal plugin version set to 1.13 of the Spigot API and tested on version 1.16 of the API. If your plugin uses newer or older Minecraft API features, you can change that in `plugin.yml`.
* Compiles with Maven.
* Compilation tested on MacOS Java 14.
* To support older servers compiled with Java 8, target was changed to 1.8 in `pom.yml`.
* Tested plugin on these servers:
    * Spigot 1.16.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT (compile with Java 14 on MacOS) when testing plugin locally.
    * Paper 1.16.4 (compiled with Java 8) running on a paid hosting service using an older version of Java.

## Steps for using this template for your own projects

- [ ] Read about [Spigot plugin development](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/) (recommended).
- [ ] Create a new package (instead of `com.briangershon.demo`) and matching folder structure. Move `App.java` in there. Add your plugin logic.
- [ ] Update `plugin.yml` and populate with the meta data for your plugin.
- [ ] Update `pom.xml` top section to match your plugin as well as `<dependency>` section if you're using a different Spigot version.

## To compile

Setup dependencies for your environment. Refer to [Creating a blank Spigot plugin, using Maven](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/creating-a-plugin-with-maven-using-intellij-idea/).

For MacOS, Java 14 was installed and then Maven installed via Home Brew (`brew install maven`).

Prior to compiling, update the version of your plugin if needed in `pom.xml`.

Compile:

    mvn clean package

## To install on your Spigot compatable Minecraft Server

Copy `target/PluginDemo-n.n.n.jar` to your server `/plugin` folder, and reload server configuration (or just restart server).

You should see these two messages in your server console:

```
[11:50:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [PluginDemo] Enabling PluginDemo v0.0.1
[11:50:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [PluginDemo] Hello, SpigotMC!
```
