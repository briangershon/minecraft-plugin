# PluginDemo

This is a starter Minecraft plugin.

Features:

- Minimal Minecraft Plugin based on [Creating a blank Spigot plugin, using Maven](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/creating-a-plugin-with-maven-using-intellij-idea/).
- Minimal plugin version set to 1.13 of the Spigot API and tested on `Spigot-API 1.20.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT` version of the API. If your plugin uses newer or older Minecraft API features, you can change that in `plugin.yml`.
- Compiles with Maven.
- Compilation to Java 8 tested on MacOS Java 21 JDK.
- To support older servers compiled with Java 8, target was changed to 1.8 in `pom.yml`.
- Supports API version 1.13 or higher. Plugin tested on:
  - Spigot 1.20.1 (compiled to Java 8 target) when testing plugin locally.

## Steps for using this template for your own projects

- [ ] Read about [Spigot plugin development](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/) (recommended).
- [ ] Rename existing `demo` folder at `src/main/java/com/briangershon/demo` folder to be your own, then search-and-replace `com.briangershon.demo` with name of your package. `App.java` is where you'll start adding your plugin logic.
- [ ] Update `src/main/resources/plugin.yml` and populate with the meta data for your plugin.
- [ ] Update `pom.xml` top section to match your plugin, specifically `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>`, and `<version>`. Plus `<dependency>` section if you're using a different Spigot version. You can find name of spigot versions at <https://hub.spigotmc.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/spigotmc/spigot-api/>.
- [ ] Compile and install on your local server and make sure everything is working correctly. See "Releasing Plugin" below for steps.
- [ ] Clear out this README and tailor for your specific plugin

## Development Environment Setup and Workflow

If you haven't create a plugin before, you'll need to setup your local development environment and understand the compile and test workflow. I've created a [Minecraft Plugin Development Guide](https://gist.github.com/briangershon/7a009cad2a1e11a7b785e8b8bf6ada1a) to cover this.

## Releasing Plugin

Make sure you first update the plugin version in `pom.xml` in `<version>1.0.0</version>`.

    mvn clean package

You should now have your new plugin jar file in `target` folder.

## To install on your Spigot compatable Minecraft Server

Copy `target/PluginDemo-n.n.n.jar` to your server `/plugin` folder, and reload server configuration via `reload` command (or just restart server).

You should see these two messages in your server console:

```
[11:50:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [PluginDemo] Enabling PluginDemo v0.0.1
[11:50:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [PluginDemo] Hello, SpigotMC!
```
